# Fails if IWYU didn't run, or if any run failed or reported an error
# (including a mapping file it couldn't open), since either means that
# building with HIPOBJ_USE_IWYU no longer works. IWYU's suggestions are
# advisory and don't fail the check; it lists the files IWYU suggests
# changing.

# summary is appended to it. In GitHub Actions, the result is also
