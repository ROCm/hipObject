# Run include-what-you-use (IWYU) and record the run
#
# CMake only shows IWYU's output when IWYU suggests a change, and it
# ignores IWYU's exit status, so a run that fails (for example, because
# IWYU's clang can't parse a file) leaves no trace in the build log and
# doesn't fail the build. To catch that, point CMake at this script
# instead of at IWYU, and set HIPOBJ_IWYU_LOG_DIR to an existing
# directory when building:
#
#   cmake -B build -DHIPOBJ_USE_IWYU=ON -DHIPOBJ_IWYU_EXE="$PWD/ci/iwyu/iwyu-wrapper.sh"
#   mkdir build/iwyu-runs
#   HIPOBJ_IWYU_LOG_DIR="$PWD/build/iwyu-runs" cmake --build build
#   ci/iwyu/check-iwyu.sh build/iwyu-runs
#
# For each run, this saves the arguments, output, and exit status in
# HIPOBJ_IWYU_LOG_DIR for check-iwyu.sh to check. IWYU's output and exit
# status are passed through, so CMake behaves as it does without this
# script.
#
# HIPOBJ_IWYU_WRAPPED_EXE selects the IWYU to run. It defaults to the
# include-what-you-use on PATH.
