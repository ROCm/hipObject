# Changelog for hipObject

## (Unreleased) hipObject 0.1.0

### Added

### Changed

- hipObject is now built as plain C/C++ instead of HIP. It contains no GPU
  kernels, so the HIP language (and its per-architecture device compilation
  pass) is no longer enabled. The HIP runtime is still used via the
  `hip::host` CMake target. `CMAKE_HIP_COMPILER` no longer needs to be set
  when configuring.
- hipObject is now built as C++20 (without compiler extensions) instead of
  C++17, so a C++20-capable compiler is required. The
  `HIPOBJ_CXX_STANDARD` CMake cache variable now defaults to `20`.

### Removed

- The `OFFLOAD_ARCH` CMake cache variable and its `rocminfo`-based GPU
  architecture detection. It was never used to set the target architecture
  and is unnecessary now that nothing is compiled for the GPU.
